    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore health violations in San Francisco restaurants using a dataset contained in the table named `sf_restaurant_health_violations`. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the patterns, trends, and severity of health violations within the food industry. This dataset was studied from scratch, and through this analysis, we aim to generate insights that may be beneficial for consumers, restaurant owners, regulatory bodies, and policy-makers.In the end on the basis of analysis, I also generated a function to calculate the inspection score for a given violation. Apart from this I have also done some data transformation and use the transformed data in last two analysis. The python script for the same is attached. I have tried my best to make the analysis easy to follow and quite interactive. Hope you will enjoy it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the details of the analysis, let's review the structure of the dataset, and the tools and methodologies employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sf_restaurant_health_violations` table contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **business_id**: Unique identifier for the business.\n",
    "- **business_name**: Name of the business.\n",
    "- **business_address**: Address of the business.\n",
    "- **business_city**: City where the business is located.\n",
    "- **business_state**: State where the business is located.\n",
    "- **business_postal_code**: Postal code of the business address.\n",
    "- **business_latitude**: Latitude coordinate of the business location.\n",
    "- **business_longitude**: Longitude coordinate of the business location.\n",
    "- **inspection_id**: Unique identifier for a particular inspection.\n",
    "- **inspection_date**: The date the inspection took place.\n",
    "- **inspection_score**: The score assigned to the business based on the inspection.\n",
    "- **inspection_type**: Type of inspection conducted.\n",
    "- **violation_id**: Unique identifier for the violation.\n",
    "- **violation_description**: Detailed description of the violation.\n",
    "- **risk_category**: The risk level associated with the violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, SQL queries were utilized to extract and manipulate data from the `sf_restaurant_health_violations` table. To visualize and present the findings in a more interpretable manner, this analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for the integration of live code, visualizations, and narrative text. Python scripts were also used for the data transformations and for building custom functions.\n",

    "## Significance of This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Food safety is a critical component of public health. For consumers, it is essential to have trust in the sanitary practices of the restaurants they frequent. Restaurant owners need to uphold high standards not only to comply with regulations but also to maintain customer trust and their business reputation. Regulatory bodies must monitor and ensure that food establishments adhere to safety standards to safeguard public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis was performed from scratch with the aim to unravel the intricate aspects of health violations in San Francisco's restaurants. The insights derived can help in making informed decisions, encourage restaurants to enhance their safety protocols, and facilitate data-driven policy-making for regulatory bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's delve into the analysis and uncover the hidden insights."

    "# Data Preprocessing: Changing the Granularity of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin our analysis, it's important to understand the level of granularity in the original dataset, `sf_restaurant_health_violations`. In this dataset, each row corresponds to a single violation, which means that an inspection with multiple violations will have multiple rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the purpose of our analysis, we are making an assumption and changing the granularity to the inspection level. In other words, each row in our modified dataset will correspond to a single inspection. Additionally, we want to categorize each inspection as either 'High Risk', 'Moderate Risk', 'Low Risk', or 'No Violation' if there is a null value indicating no violations were recorded during the inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this transformation, we will create a view named `restaurant_health_violations`. This view is generated by employing SQL window functions and other clauses to ensure that each inspection is represented only once and is associated with a single violation category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the SQL query that creates the view `restaurant_health_violations`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW restaurant_health_violations AS (\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        business_id, business_name, business_address, business_city, \n",
    "        business_state, business_postal_code, business_latitude, \n",
    "        business_longitude, business_location, business_phone_number,\n",
    "        inspection_id, inspection_date, inspection_score, inspection_type,\n",
    "        violation_id, violation_description, risk_category\n",
    "    FROM (\n",
    "        SELECT\n",
    "            *,\n",
    "            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY inspection_id) AS rn\n",
    "        FROM sf_restaurant_health_violations\n",
    "    ) AS a\n",
    "    WHERE rn = 1\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are selecting several columns from the original dataset, including business details, inspection details, and violation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a window function `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign a unique number to each row within a partition of `inspection_id`. This helps us in selecting only one row for each inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the outer query, we filter out the rows where the row number is 1, ensuring that only one row per inspection is present in the final view.\n",
    "\n",
    "This view, `restaurant_health_violations`, will now serve as the foundation for our analysis. It has been designed to provide a streamlined and simplified version of the data, with each inspection being represented once and associated with a single violation category."

    "# Yearly Trend Analysis of Health Violations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the essential parts of our analysis is to study the yearly trends of health violations. This enables us to understand how the nature and severity of violations have evolved over time. By analyzing the data yearly, we can identify patterns and possibly predict future trends.\n",

    "This query extracts the following information grouped by year:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total number of inspections that had violations.\n",
    "- Average inspection score.\n",

    "- **year**: This represents the year in which inspections were performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **total_violated_inspections**: The total number of inspections conducted in that year which recorded violations.\n",

    "- **avg_inspection_score**: The average inspection score for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each risk category (Low, Moderate, High):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[risk]_risk_total_inspections**: The number of inspections that were categorized as Low/Moderate/High risk in that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[risk]_risk_relative_pct**: The percentage of inspections that were categorized as Low/Moderate/High risk relative to the total violated inspections of that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[risk]_risk_avg_inspection_score**: The average inspection score for inspections that fell into the respective risk category in that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the output provided, let's analyze what is concerning and what seems positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concerning Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Risk Violations in 2016**: In 2016, 20.5% of the total violated inspections were categorized as \"High Risk\". This is a significant proportion and is higher than other years in the dataset. High-risk violations are the most concerning as they can have severe consequences for public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decline in Average Inspection Score in 2017**: In 2017, the average inspection score declined to 77.2 from 78.9 in 2016. A decline in the average inspection score indicates that, on average, there were more or more severe violations in that year compared to the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positive Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase in Average Inspection Score in 2018**: In 2018, there was an increase in the average inspection score to 84.3 from 77.2 in 2017. This might indicate an improvement in the general health compliance of the restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduction in High-Risk Violations in 2018**: Only 7.0% of inspections were categorized as \"High Risk\" in 2018, compared to 17.9% in 2017. This reduction in high-risk violations is a positive sign and may indicate that restaurants are taking steps to address and mitigate serious health violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move through the years from 2015 to 2018, we can observe several trends in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Inspection Score Fluctuations**: The average inspection score initially declines from 85.9 in 2015 to 77.2 in 2017 but then shows improvement, rising to 84.3 in 2018. The decline may signal that violations were becoming more severe or more frequent, but the rebound in 2018 suggests some improvement in health compliance or changes in inspection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shifting Risk Categories**: The proportion of high-risk violations increases sharply in 2016 to 20.5%, but then we see a steady decline in subsequent years (17.9% in 2017 and 7.0% in 2018). This decline is a positive trend, indicating that severe violations are becoming less common over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the data shows a trend towards improvement, particularly in terms of reducing high-risk violations and stabilizing average inspection scores."

    "## Explanation:\n",
    "In this analysis, we are examining the different risk categories of health violations in restaurants and the corresponding inspection scores. The risk categories are \"High Risk,\" \"Low Risk,\" \"Moderate Risk,\" and \"No Violation.\" For each category, the total number of inspections that fall under this category, the average inspection score, the minimum inspection score, and the maximum inspection score are computed using the SQL query above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Violations**: There are 72 inspections with no violations. This indicates that in these inspections, the establishments met all the health standards. However, the average score in this category is not particularly meaningful since there were no violations to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Risk Violations**: There were 33 inspections that fell under the \"High Risk\" category. These inspections had an average score of 71.3, with scores ranging from 0 to 93. This is concerning as high-risk violations can have severe consequences for public health. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Low Risk Violations**: The \"Low Risk\" category had the highest number of inspections with 102. These had an average score of 83.0, with scores ranging from 0 to 98. The high average score and the high number of inspections in this category suggest that while violations were identified, they were generally of lesser severity and may represent areas where minor improvements are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Moderate Risk Violations**: There were 72 inspections that fell under the \"Moderate Risk\" category, with an average score of 78.8. The scores in this category ranged from 0 to 96. This indicates a middle ground between high and low-risk violations in terms of severity. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Score Range**: The minimum score of 0 in all categories except \"No Violation\" is concerning and indicates that there are instances where the violations were severe enough to warrant the lowest possible score. \n"

    "This analysis provides insights into how inspection scores are assigned in cases where no violations were identified. A score of 0 seems to be commonly used to signify the absence of violations, but a perfect score of 100 is also used, possibly to reward exceptional compliance. The absence of any other scores indicates a clear distinction in the scoring method for non-violation inspections, which is beneficial for data consistency and interpretation."

    "## Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the analysis, we are diving deeper into the different risk categories to understand the specific types of violations that contribute to each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "### High Risk Violations:\n",
    "The top high-risk violation is \"High-risk food holding temperature\" with a total of 8 inspections violated due to this. This is a critical violation since improper food temperature can lead to bacterial growth and foodborne illnesses. Other concerning high-risk violations include \"Unclean hands or improper use of gloves\" and \"Improper cooling methods.\" These types of violations are considered high risk as they directly impact food safety and can have severe consequences for the consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moderate Risk Violations:\n",
    "Within the moderate risk category, the most frequent violation is “Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities” with 16 inspections. This is followed by “Moderate risk food holding temperature” and “Moderate risk vermin infestation.” Although these violations are not as severe as high-risk ones, they are still significant as they can compromise food safety to some extent. Ensuring proper handwashing facilities and maintaining food at safe temperatures are important to minimize the risk of contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low Risk Violations:\n",
    "In the low-risk category, the most common violations are related to the maintenance and cleanliness of the establishment, such as “Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils” and “Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings.” These violations are less likely to cause foodborne illnesses but are still important for the overall hygiene and functionality of the establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For high-risk violations, the focus should be on training staff in food safety practices, especially around food temperature control and personal hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the case of moderate-risk violations, improving the availability and accessibility of handwashing facilities and ensuring proper food temperature can help in reducing the number of violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For low-risk violations, regular maintenance and cleaning schedules can help in ensuring that the establishment meets the required standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Restaurant owners and managers should be made aware of the common violations and encouraged to take proactive steps in ensuring compliance with health standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while high-risk violations are the most concerning, attention must also be given to moderate and low-risk violations to ensure the overall safety and hygiene of the establishments."

    "2. **Count of Inspections**: The second query provides us with the total number of inspections for SAFEWAY STORE #964, which is 2. This signifies that the regulatory authorities found it necessary to conduct inspections for this business more than once in a single year, which might indicate previous violations or complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inspection Details**: The third query presents us with detailed information regarding the two inspections of SAFEWAY STORE #964. The first inspection occurred on June 9, 2016, with an inspection score of 81. This inspection was classified as \"Routine - Unscheduled\" and the business was cited for unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils, which was categorized as \"Low Risk\". The second inspection took place on June 24, 2016, and was triggered by a complaint. The score for this inspection is recorded as 0, which can be interpreted as not being scored or the result of a complaint-based inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concerns and Action Points**: It is concerning that SAFEWAY STORE #964 required multiple inspections within a short period. This could indicate non-compliance with health regulations or other issues that warranted attention from regulatory authorities. It is essential for the business to address the violations and ensure adherence to health standards. Moreover, regulatory authorities"

    "# 7:  Calculating Inspection Scores for Restaurant Health Violations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `sf_restaurant_health_violations_original` contains various columns such as `violation_description`, `inspection_score`, and `risk_category`. The `risk_category` can be 'High Risk', 'Moderate Risk', or 'Low Risk'. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a system that can calculate the deduction points and the final inspection score for any given violation.As we stated earlier that we are assuming only one violation per inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a View of Violation Points\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a view named `cte_violation_points` that consolidates all types of violations along with the average points to deduct for each violation category.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW cte_violation_points AS (\n",
    "    -- High Risk Violations\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        violation_description AS risk_violations,\n",
    "        100 - AVG(inspection_score) AS points_to_deduct,\n",
    "        \"High Risk\" AS RiskCategory\n",
    "    FROM\n",
    "        sf_restaurant_health_violations_original\n",
    "    WHERE\n",
    "        risk_category = \"High Risk\"\n",
    "    GROUP BY\n",
    "        violation_description\n",
    "    \n",
    "    UNION\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Moderate Risk Violations\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        violation_description AS risk_violations,\n",
    "        100 - AVG(inspection_score) AS points_to_deduct,\n",
    "        \"Moderate Risk\" AS RiskCategory\n",
    "    FROM\n",
    "        sf_restaurant_health_violations_original\n",
    "    WHERE\n",
    "        risk_category = \"Moderate Risk\"\n",
    "    GROUP BY\n",
    "        violation_description\n",
    "    \n",
    "    UNION\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Low Risk Violations\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        violation_description AS risk_violations,\n",
    "        100 - AVG(inspection_score) AS points_to_deduct,\n",
    "        \"Low Risk\" AS RiskCategory\n",

    "        risk_category = \"Low Risk\"\n",
    "    GROUP BY\n",
    "        violation_description\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create a Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create a stored procedure named `GetDeductionScore` that takes a violation description as input and returns both the corresponding points to deduct and the final inspection score.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER //\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetDeductionScore(IN risk_violation_param VARCHAR(255), OUT deduction_score DECIMAL(10,2), OUT inspection_score DECIMAL (10,2))\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT points_to_deduct, 100 - points_to_deduct INTO deduction_score, inspection_score\n",
    "    FROM cte_violation_points\n",
    "    WHERE risk_violations = risk_violation_param;\n",
    "END //\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Calculate Deduction and Inspection Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we call the stored procedure by providing a specific violation. The stored procedure will then return the deduction points and the final inspection score for the given violation.\n",
    "\n",

    "By using a view and stored procedure, we successfully automated the calculation of inspection scores based on restaurant health violations. This system can be utilized by health inspectors to easily calculate the scores for different restaurants based on the violations reported. This not only increases the efficiency but also ensures that the scores are standardized and transparent.\n",
